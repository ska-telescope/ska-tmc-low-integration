        #This BDD test performs TMC-SDP pairwise testing to verify Abort command flow.

        Scenario: Abort invocation using TMC
                Given TMC and SDP subarray are busy assigning resources
                When I command it to Abort
                Then the SDP subarray should go into an aborted obsstate
                And the TMC subarray obsState transitions to ABORTED
