    Scenario: Standby the telescope having TMC and SDP subsystems
        Given a Telescope consisting of TMC and SDP that is in ON State
        And  simulated CSP and MCCS in ON States
        And telescope state is ON
        When I put the telescope to STANDBY
        Then the sdp controller must go to STANDBY State
        And the sdp subarray must go to OFF State
        And telescope state is STANDBY
