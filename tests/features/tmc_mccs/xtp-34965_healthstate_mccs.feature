Scenario Outline: Verify CentralNode TelescopeHealthState
    Given a Telescope consisting of TMC,MCCS,emulated SDP and emulated CSP 
    And the Telescope is in ON state
    When The <devices> health state changes to <health_state> 
    Then the telescope health state is <telescope_health_state>
    Examples:
    | devices                           | health_state               | telescope_health_state |
    | mccs controller                   | DEGRADED                   |   DEGRADED             |
    | mccs controller,sdp master        | DEGRADED,DEGRADED          |   DEGRADED             |
    | mccs controller,csp master        | DEGRADED,DEGRADED          |   DEGRADED             |
    | mccs controller,sdp master        | DEGRADED,OK                |   DEGRADED             |
    | mccs controller,csp master        | DEGRADED,OK                |   DEGRADED             |
