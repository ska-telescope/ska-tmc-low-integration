Feature: Handling Invalid Station Id in MCCS controller
@XTP-34263 @XTP-34276 @Team_himalaya
Scenario: The TMC Low Subarray reports the exception triggered by the MCCS controller when it encounters an invalid station ID.
      Given a Telescope consisting of TMC-MCCS, emulated SDP and emulated CSP
      And the Telescope is in the ON state
      And the TMC subarray is in EMPTY obsState
      When I assign resources with invalid <station_id> to the MCCS subarray using TMC with <subarray_id>
      Then the MCCS controller should throw the error for invalid station id
      Then the MCCS controller rejects invalid station id
      And the TMC propogate the error to the client
      And the TMC SubarrayNode remains in RESOURCING obsState
      Examples:
      | station_id       | subarray_id |
      | 15               | 1           |
